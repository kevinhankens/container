Hurdles
-------
- MySQL db/user creation
  - PHP file containing db creds for pre-install?
  - install drupal on new site creation?
- Apache-writable sites/ dir
- Apache virtualhost entries?

Queue
-----
- Form allows you to name a job(drush command)
- Callback/Webservice executes drush command in the background and exits
- Drush command executes a drush command on one or all sites
- Parent drush command records all of the subsequent job names and commands into a queue table
- Parent drush command then iterates over all queue items, marking them as complete
- JS can call another callback/webservice to get status on the queue
